% Tempest Version 0.1 | A really ridiculously stupidly simple template engine.

NAME
====

**tempest** â€” performs template substitutions.  

SYNOPSIS
========

| **tempest** TEMPLATE [-D DEFS]  [-i INCLS] [-I INCL_DIRS] [-o OUT] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Tempest is a really ridiculously stupidly simple template engine.
It is designed to make it easy to build complex text files using simple templates.
Tempest templates have only two options 1) replace a string or 2) insert a file contents.
Data for populating the templates is supplied in a simple flat JSON file and/or command line arguments.

Options
-------
Tempest is designed to have familiar arguments to C compiler (e.g. GCC, CLANG).
This should make it easy to integrate into Makefile environments.

TEMPLATE

:    Template file to perform replacements on. 

-h, --help

:   Prints brief usage information.

-D DEFS

:   Manual definitions in the form "name=value"

-i INCLS      

:     One or more JSON dictionaries defining insertions/replacements map

-I INCL_DIRS  

:    Directory to look in for inclusion files

-o OUT

:   Outputs the result to the given filename.

-v, --version

:   Prints the current version number.

USAGE
=========
## String replacement
String replacement is performed using the `$$` special symbol. For example
```
My name is $$name
```
With the command line option
```
-Dname=Matthew
```
Or with the JOSN file
```
{
    "name":"Matthew"
}
```

The `$$` literal can be escaped using `$$$$`.

If the substitution pattern is contained in another string (e.g. "$names") then the escaped pattern `${name}` may be used instead.

## File Insertion
File insertion is performed using the `##` special symbol. For example
```
##config
```
With the command line option
```
-Dconfig=/etc/config.conf
```
Or with the JOSN file
```
{
    "confif":"/etc/config.conf"
}
```
